# Rayleigh Flow Assignment

## Problem 2
Reproduce the Rayleigh flow plots shown in class:

- Plot the ratios of thermodynamic properties to their respective diabatic sonic counterparts:  
  \[
  \frac{p}{p^*}, \quad \frac{T}{T^*}, \quad \frac{T_0}{T_0^*}, \; \ldots
  \]
  as functions of Mach number.
- Generate the normalized **T–s diagram** (Temperature–Entropy diagram) with appropriate scaling.

## Problem 3
Build on the code from Problem 2 to implement a **general Rayleigh flow solver**:

- Write a function with clear arguments and outputs that computes Rayleigh flow properties for given inputs.
- Reuse plotting routines where appropriate.
- Validate your solver by applying it to **Examples 3.13 and 3.14** from *Anderson (2003 edition)*, or two equivalent cases of your choice.  
  - Ensure both subsonic and supersonic regimes are tested.
- Compare your results against the textbook solutions for verification.
